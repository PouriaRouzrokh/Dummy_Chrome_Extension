# Dummy Chrome Extension

In this repository, I'll implement and test different chrome extension features by developing dummy extensions.

The current extensions:

- v1: demonstrates a simple chrome extension with modular imports, webpack builds, and sidebar.
- v2: demonstrates the functionality to load curl APIs from saved templates on the disk and runs them from the background.js
